					Has anyone used Self-Organizing Maps (<abbr title="Self-Organizing Map">SOM</abbr>s) with very high dimensionality?
					What about using Self-Organizing Maps (<abbr title="Self-Organizing Map">SOM</abbr>s) with non-Euclidean distance measures?
					I suppose one could also consider Self-Organizing Maps (<abbr title="Self-Organizing Map">SOM</abbr>s) on non-numerical data, where non-Euclidean distance measures tend to be a <em>must</em>.
