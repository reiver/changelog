				<p>
					My philosophy when designing software that other engineers are going to use (such as <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>s and libraries) is to,
					make the things they do often easier,
					but don't force them them use it
					and don't prevent them from accessing "lower" levels.
					Ignoring this philosophy will likely result in engineers <em>fighting with</em> you framework and cursing its creator.
