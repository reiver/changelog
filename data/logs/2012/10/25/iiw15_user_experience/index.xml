	<title>IIW 15: User Experience &amp; Single Sign-On</title>

	<content type="xhtml">

		<p>
			I was at the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (<abbr title="Internet Identity Workshop">IIW</abbr>) 15, in Mountain View near San Francisco.
			I attended a number of the sessions, during this unconference.
			One of the sessions I attended was a <em>user experience</em> session hosted by (I think) <a rel="nofollow" href="http://skypejournal.com/">Phil Wolff</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the session, it was noted that in a household environment, there is also a household (group) identity and not just individual identity.
			I have had this complaint for a long time!
		</p>
		<p>
			A question that was raise was: should devices store your preference settings, when dealing with (single sign-on and identity)?
		</p>
		<p>
			It was noted that, a motivation for consistent User Experience with Single Sign-on with devices is (partially) less cognitive burden.
		</p>
		<p>
			What follows are my notes from that session.
			Basically a copy of what was on the whiteboard.
