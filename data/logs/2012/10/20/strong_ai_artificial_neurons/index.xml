	<title>Artificial Neuron Models for Strong AI?</title>

	<content type="xhtml">
	<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
		<p>
			The original goal of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong><abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr></strong>) was to create <strong>human-like intelligence</strong> <em><abbr title="performed on computer or via computer simulation">in silico</abbr></em>.
			Modern <em><abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr></em>, while useful and instances of (real) intelligence, are (for the most part) nothing like human intelligence.
		</p>
		<p>
			Given that the <em>AI</em> label has come to cover much more than just human-like intelligence,
			this goal, of creating <em>human-like intelligence in silico</em>, has been given a new label and is now called <strong>strong AI</strong>,
			but also goes by the names <strong>artificial general intelligence</strong> (<strong>AGI</strong>) and <strong>cognitive AI</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the time of writing, there is really no how-to guide for <em>strong AI</em>.
			I'd be (happily) surprised to see one any time soon.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Strong AI</em> is very much a frontier of AI and machine learning research.
			And no one knows how to create a <em>strong AI</em> yet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sure people have different opinions and ideas.
			(I even have some.)
			But (unless someone figured it out and is keeping it a secret) it is still an open question.
		</p>
		<p>
			My (perhaps mistaken) impression of the mainstream approach to <em>strong AI</em> research is to
			create a vision system, 
			create a language system,
			create a balance system,
			etc,
			and then some how connect these all together and (<em>voil√†</em>) expect it will give you human-like intelligence.
		</p>
		<p>
			(This mainstream approach is to try to create an <em>artificial mind</em>.)
		</p>
		<p>
			While this approach may give you some kind of (artificial) intelligence, (for reasons I won't go into at the moment) I doubt it will give you human-like intelligence.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>So how does one go about trying to create <em>strong AI</em>?</strong>
		</p>

		<h2>Artificial Mind versus Artificial Brain</h2>
		<p>
			This is not my original <a href="http://changelog.ca/quote/2011/06/27/an_emergent_approach_to_artificial_general_intelligence">idea</a>, but it is one I agree with....
		</p>
		<p>
			We have no idea how the mind works.
			So let's not try to create an artificial mind.
			Instead let's try to create an artificial brain and let the mind emerge.
		</p>
		<p>
			(For reasons I won't get into here, there are reasons to suspect that much of how the brain organizes itself is emergent through exposure to the environment.)
		</p>
		<p>
			So then, how does one go about creating an artificial brain&#8253;
		</p>

		<h2>Learn Neuroscience</h2>
		<p>
			This is what motivated me to start learning neuroscience.
			And what I found is that, even though modern neuroscience has learned a lot about the brain, there is <strong>a lot</strong> that is not known!
			In some ways, modern neuroscience is very primitive.
		</p>
		<p>
			So there is no straightforward way to create an artificial brain.
		</p>
		<p>
			And thus pursuing strong AI research is no simple undertaking!
		</p>
		<p>
			Neuroscience is a big field though, so <strong>I've tried to focus on things that would help me model the brain</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, insight can come from unexpected places, so I haven't been too strict about this, and have broadened my neuroscience coverage beyond this.
			It's difficult to know what you need to know.
		</p>

		<h2>Models</h2>
		<p>
			When you model something, you are leaving out details.
			You make a perhaps implicit decision that some parts of the real system aren't important and some are.
			(The important parts being what you model; and the unimportant parts being left out of your model.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Brains are made of atoms; atoms are made of protons, electrons, and neutrons; protons and neutrons are made of quarks.
		</p>
		<p>
			Do we model all this?
			(Should our model of the brain be at the quark level, taking into account things such as quantum mechanics?)
			Or is the essence of our system more easily and more usefully represented with higher level constructs?
		</p>

		<h2>Neural Networks</h2>
		<p>
			When most people think of <em>AI</em> and the brain, they often think of <strong>artificial neural networks</strong> (<strong><abbr title="artificial neural networks">ANN</abbr></strong>s).
			But the brain is <strong>NOT</strong> an <em>neural network</em>;
			it has them, but the brain is much more than an <em>neural network</em>, and have a lot of structure to them beyond this.
			(<em><abbr title="artificial neural networks">ANN</abbr></em>s are not enough.)
		</p>
		<p>
			The type of <em><abbr title="artificial neural networks">ANN</abbr></em> most people get introduced to is the <em>feedforward neural network</em>.
			The brain definitely does not work that way.
			The brain has a lot of feedback and (directed) cycles in it.
			Something that <em>feedforward neural networks</em> lack.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some people use <em>spiking neural networks</em> (<em><abbr title="spiking neural networks">SNN</abbr></em>s) to try to get closer to what's happening in the brain.
			But I'm not sure that's enough.
		</p>
		<p>
			For one, <a href="http://changelog.ca/quote/2011/08/12/it_is_not_just_about_the_connections_between_neurons_but_their_locations_too">there seems to be micro-brainwaves going on that is affecting the spiking</a>.
			So <strong>where</strong> a neuron is seems to matter (and not just how they are connected).
			(This isn't accounted for in any artificial neural network model I've seen, outside of stuff I have experimented with.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, there's some evidence that <a href="http://changelog.ca/quote/2011/08/15/glia_brain_cells_broadcast_messages">(some of) the glia cells may be doing computation too</a>.
			(I have never seen that taken into account in any artificial model, outside of stuff I have experimented with.)
		</p>
		<p>
			From what I've gathered, in the <em>computational neuroscience</em> circles, the <em>leaky integrate-and-fire model</em> of the neuron is popular.
			But I'm not sure that's enough.
		</p>
		<p>
			So what type of <em><abbr title="artificial neural networks">ANN</abbr></em> and <em>artificial neuron</em> model is correct (for our strong AI purposes)?
		</p>
		<p>
			The truth is, I don't know (yet).
			But it is one of the things that I am trying to figure out in my spare time.
			Although, the older I get, the less and less free time I seem to get :-( 
		</p>
		<p>
			With modelling, there's always the difficultly of figuring out, what are the important details and what aren't.
			(So are the details I mentioned important or not? I don't know yet.)
		</p>
		<p>
			At the moment I have more questions than answers.
			Most of those questions aren't even mentioned here.
			(There is <strong>so much more</strong> to strong AI than the choice of <em>artificial neuron</em> model and <em>artificial neural network</em> type.)
		</p>

		<h2>Et Cetera</h2>
		<p>
			It is also possible that, at least with some parts of the brain, that modelling neurons might be at a lower level than we need to be.
			Perhaps, at least with some parts of the brain, their essence is more easily and more usefully represented with higher level constructs.
		</p>
		<p>
			There's also reason (which I don't mention here) to suspect that in addition to an artificial brain, an artificial body might be important too, to get human-like intelligence.
		</p>
		<p>
			And what about the role of <a href="http://changelog.ca/quote/2011/07/05/some_of_what_some_noncoding_dna_might_do">microRNA in the brain</a>?
		</p>
		<p>
			What about the role the human brain plays in homeostasis?
		</p>
		<p>
			Etc?
			(And this is a <strong>big</strong> "etc".
			At the moment, I don't feel like writing any more than what I have.
			But there is a lot more to say!
			Even on modelling artificial neurons.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Like I said, I have more questions than answers :-)
			But if <em>strong AI</em> is something that interests you, then trying to figure out the answers to these questions (and figure out new questions) is part of the fun :-)
		</p>
		<p>
			(Also, in case it needs to be said explicitly: not all neurons in an artificial brain will necessarily be modelled the same way; since not all neurons is the real brain are the same.)
