			It shouldn't be so difficult for me to follow a blog or anything else that (somehow) exposes a webfeed or any other kind of feed.
		</p>
		<p>
			How about if I tweet, bookmark or post something that contains (one or more) link(s),
			then some system goes and tentatively auto-subscribes (me) to any RSS/Atom feed (or any other kind of feed) it finds associated with the links in said tweet or bookmark. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Then use various explicit and implicit techniques could be used to figure out what to stay subscribed to, and how to organize.
