	<title>Distributed Curation?</title>

	<content type="xhtml">
	<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
		<p>
			Are there any systems that do <em>distributed curation</em> of the same content, such that each curator's end result would be a different subset? 
		</p>
		<p>
			I suppose if one considers the <em>content</em> to be the entire web, then things like twitter, delicious, etc are examples, 
			<strong>but</strong> what about a forum or the comments on a blog post (where the curator decides what is signal and what is noise)
			and anyone could be a curator (of the forum and blog comments) presenting their own curated view (of the forum and blog comments).
		</p>
		<p>
			Or what about a book that many people work together to write, and each curator decides which person's contribution to keep so that you would have a different version of that book from each curator.
