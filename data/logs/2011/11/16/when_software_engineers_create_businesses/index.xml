	<title>When Software Engineers Create Businesses: E-mailing versus Phone Calls</title>

	<content type="xhtml">

		<p>
			I think one problem software engineers can have when they either own a company or are self-employed is that they'd rather communicate to a potential new customer via e-mail rather than talk to them on the phone.
		</p>

			Problem is, (I think) many many customers prefer the phone call and won't respond to an e-mail
			And this is even the case when the customer initiated the conversation!
