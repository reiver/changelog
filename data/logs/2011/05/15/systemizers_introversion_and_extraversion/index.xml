			I wonder if Introverts would still be Introverted if most people shared their cognition style.
			For example, systemizers, while (in my experience are) introverted around most, seem to be "social" around each other.
			Perhaps (at least some kinds of) introversion is about incompatibility/compatibility of cognition styles.
