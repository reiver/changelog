	<title>Blogging, Microblogging And Starting Conversations</title>

			One of the shortcomings of blogs as a technology is that (at least from a <em>netiquette</em> point-of-view) you can't just start a conversation with someone about any topic where there isn't a blog post for that topic already.
		</p>
		<p>
			(Sure you could post <em>off-topic</em> in the comments of some post.
			Or you could address a blog post, on your own blog, to a person and hope they notice it and reply.
			Neither seems to "work" very well though, if at all.)
		</p>
		<p>
			<a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> (a popular microblogging service, which made microblogging mainstream) is somewhat an improvement with that respect, where you can easily start a (public) conversation.	
		</p>
		<p>
			To do so on Twitter, you simply address the message to them by putting their username with a "<code>@</code>" symbol in front of it 
first, and then write your message.
			Messages in this style will show up in their "replies" feed.
			For example:
		</p>
<pre><code>
@reiver Do you know how the neocortex works?

</code></pre>
		<p>
			(This will message will show up in the "replies" feed of the Twitter user with the username "reiver".)
		</p>
		<p>
			You can talk to more than one person at the same time.
			For example:			
		</p>
<pre><code>
@reiver @cosmicblend I agree.

</code></pre>
