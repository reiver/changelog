	<title>Code Analyzer For Costliness?</title>

	<content type="xhtml">
	<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
		<p>
			I need a tool that can mark procedures in code as '<em>costly</em>' (such as when it includes an API calls over Internet),
			analyze the code into a graph, and propagate the "mark of <em>costliness</em>" up the graph.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, if all of a sudden a usage of a '<em>costly</em>' procedure goes from O(1) to O(n) (or worse) you <strong>REALLY</strong> need to know that.
			(One way that could happen is if a '<em>costly</em>' procedure is called from within a loop.)
		</p>
		<p>
			This isn't something a QA process <em>usually</em> can detect.
			Stress testing can help find this, but does not tell you WHY it happens.
			A tool like the one I want can be one thing that can help you figure out the '<em>why</em>'.
		</p>
		<p>
			Obviously there could be other '<em>whys</em>' for why stress tests fail though.
			And if you don't do stress tests, then discovering these things in production will negatively effect your subjective well-being.
		</p>
		<p>
			Wonder if anyone else already created a tool like that.
			(Or will I have to create the tool myself.)
		</p>
		<p>
			This tool is useful in team environments, when a lot of people are working on code, and mistakes in <em>Computational Complexity</em> can creep in.
			It would sort of be a sibling of unit tests.
