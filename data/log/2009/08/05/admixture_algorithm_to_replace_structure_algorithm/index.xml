			<a href="http://dienekes.blogspot.com/2009/08/admixture-new-program-for-model-based.html">Dienekes Pontikos points</a> me to &#8220;a new program for model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals&#8221; called ADMIXTURE.  Which is geared to replace STRUCTURE.
		</p>
		<p>
			Why does ADMIXTURE or STRUCTURE matter?  This are some of tools that creates those nice <i>genetic maps</i> that so many people are fond of.

		<blockquote> 
			<p>
				The improvement in speed is very important, as STRUCTURE runs very slowly for large number of markers/individuals. The authors write:
			</p> 
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					We are thus hesitant to make a definitive statement regarding the speed of admixture versus structure. Let us simply state that in the experiments we have run on a 2.8GHz Intel Xeon computer on datasets with around 1,000 individuals and 10,000 markers, we have found that point estimation with admixture typically took on the order of minutes, while point estimation with structure took on the order of hours.

				The paper (available as a <a href="http://dalexander.bol.ucla.edu/preprints/admixture-preprint.pdf">preprint</a> from the author&#8217;s site) includes free supplementary material (<a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/suppl/2009/07/31/gr.094052.109.DC1/supplementary-material.pdf">pdf</a>).
