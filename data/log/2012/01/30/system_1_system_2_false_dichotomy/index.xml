	<title>System 1, System 2; False Dichotomy?</title>

			In <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman">Daniel Kahneman</a>'s book, "<em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>", he claims that logic is carried out by '<em>system 2</em>' ('<em>slow thinking</em>').
			Although I suspect that this is probably true for most people, I suspect for a minority of people that logic is carried out by '<em>system 1</em>' ('<em>fast thinking</em>').
		</p>
		<p>
			For example: all <strong>elite</strong> <em>software engineers</em>, I suspect, carry out logic (even complex logic) in '<em>system 1</em>' ('<em>fast thinking</em>').
			I suspect the same may also be true with mathematicians, with their version of complex logic: the mathematical proof.
			(Sometimes this can be in "one shot" and sometimes in "bursts".)
		</p>
		<p>
			Perhaps '<em>system 1</em>' ('<em>fast thinking</em>') logic abilities explain why a small minority of people are attracted to logic basic moral frameworks (<abbr title="for example">ex</abbr>: libertarianism) or (perhaps) at least partially explains it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although, all that is dependent on '<em>system 1</em>' ('<em>fast thinking</em>') versus '<em>system 2</em>' ('<em>slow thinking</em>') not being a false dichotomy.
