	<title>Bucketizing Timestamps Into Fixed Length Time Buckets</title>

	<content type="xhtml">
	<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
		<p>
			Sometimes when you create a report you want to display an aggregate or summary of you data.
			For example, perhaps a report that shows the number of e-mails you received per day.
			Or a report that shows how much revenue a company got per week.
			Or even a report that shows you (instead of a count) the maximum weight of packages a post office received per year.
		</p>
		<p>
			In general the pattern is,
			<em>a report that shows you some aggrgate of "X" you have per time period "Y"</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			When transforming your raw data into data suitable for your report or graph, one of the thing you will (likely) need to do is to figure out which time period -- which fixed length time "bucket" -- your data event should be put into.
		</p>
		<p>
			This isn't difficult to do; and the calculation is straightforward (and can be done in O(1) time -- in <em>constant time</em>).
			The PHP function below gives you an easy way of taking a timestamp and telling you what "bucket" the timestamp belongs to.
		</p>
<pre><code class="php">
function timestamp_bucketize($t, $edge, $length)
{
    $shift = $edge % $length;

    $shift_t = $t - $shift;

    $bucket_begin_timestamp = (floor($shift_t / $length) * $length) + $shift;

    return $bucket_begin_timestamp;
}

</code></pre>
		<p>
			The variable <code class="php">$t</code> is the timestamp.
		</p>
		<p>
			The variable <code class="php">$edge</code> is any valid "bucket" value. (It doesn't matter which one.)
		</p>
		<p>
			The variable <code class="php">$length</code> is the length of time for the "buckets".
		</p>

		<h2>Example Usage</h2>
		<p>
			Here's an example usage....
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's say that you are creating a report, that shows results per day.
			(Thus for you <code>$length</code> is 86400.
			86400 is the number of seconds in a day.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Now let's say that you are in Vancouver.
			(I'm pointing that out because the timezone that Vancouver is in is important.)
			Since we can pick any "bucket"'s beginning timestamp, we'll convert
			<em>June 17, 2012 at 12:00AM <abbr title="Pacific Standard Time">PST</abbr></em>
			(i.e., <em>2012-06-17T00:00:00-08:00</em>)
			into timestamp (in Unix time / POSIX time).
			which gives us 1339920000.
			Thus <code>$edge</code> is 1339920000.
			(Note, we could have used any valid "bucket" beginning timestamp.
			For example, we could have used the timestamp for
			<em>June 16, 2012 at 12:00AM <abbr title="Pacific Standard Time">PST</abbr></em>,
			<em>June 15, 2012 at 12:00AM <abbr title="Pacific Standard Time">PST</abbr></em>,
			<em>February 2, 2012 at 12:00AM <abbr title="Pacific Standard Time">PST</abbr></em>,
			<em>August 3, 1918 at 12:00AM <abbr title="Pacific Standard Time">PST</abbr></em>,
			etc.)
		</p>
		<p>
			And then, of course, <code>$t</code> is just whatever comes from your data.
