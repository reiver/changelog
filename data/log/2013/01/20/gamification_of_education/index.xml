			Here are my suggestions. Perhaps....
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				Offer 'virtual currency' for doing things that don't (directly) earn students a better grade.
				For example, such as reading certain extra books or extra academic papers you provide a list for. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Allow virtual currency to be used to increase a student's score on assignments and (possibly also) exams.
				(Of course, you'd need a way to verify those extra activities were completed.) 
			</li>
			<li>
				Also could post list of the "top 5" people for each test and assignment, online somewhere (that would be permanent).
				Students may see it as a "soft" recommendation from you.
			</li>
			<li>
				Also, giving users (virtual) badges for completing tasks (or whatever), <b>and</b> if the student opts-in, then make those (virtual) badges publicly and permanently viewable online, so that a student can have it be used as another proxy for quality (in addition to their degree).
				(Something that can be helpful for a student's career.)
			</li>
		</ul>
