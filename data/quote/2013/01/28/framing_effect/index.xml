						"CRIME is a beast ravaging the city of Addison."
						So began a fictional news report in an experiment at Stanford University.
						The report goes on to describe crime statistics in the town.
						Of those who read this passage, 71% recommended tougher law enforcement for controlling crime.
						But when a second group read an identical report with just one word changed—"Crime is a virus ravaging the city of Addison"—the proportion of those recommending tougher enforcement fell to 54%.
						One word, 17 percentage points of change, in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0016782">study</a> by Lera Boroditsky and Paul Thibodeau in 2011.
