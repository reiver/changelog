					<p>
						Evolutionary biology works by one cardinal rule: to understand an adaptation, one has to 
understand its evolved function.
						The analysis of adaptations is more than just-so stories, because according to evolutionary 
theory there are only two fundamental kinds of functions that explain adaptations.
						Adaptations can arise through natural selection for survival advantages, or sexual selection 
for reproductive advantage.
						Basically, that's it.
