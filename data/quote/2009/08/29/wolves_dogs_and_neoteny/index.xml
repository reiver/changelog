					<p>
						Dogs are much more playful than wolves, and this can probably be understood as retention of juvenile behavior (called &#8220;neoteny&#8221;).  Retaining existing juvenile behavior is accomplished far more easily than evolving a behavior from scratch.  Many of the ways in which dogs interact with humans can be understood as a new application of behavioral adaptations designed for a pack &#8212; the owner takes on the role of the leader of the pack.
