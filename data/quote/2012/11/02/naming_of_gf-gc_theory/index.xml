						The original G<i>f</i>-G<i>c</i> theory [not to be confused with <em>extended G<i>f</i>-G<i>c</i> theory</em>, which has other broad, second-order factors at the top level of its hierarchical structure] received its name when Raymond Cattell (1943; 1963) divided Spearman's factor of general intelligence into two broad, independent ones:
						fluid intelligence (G<i>f</i>) and crystallized intelligence (G<i>c</i>).
						The purpose of this separation was to account for individuals' cognitive development in adolescence and adulthood.
						G<i>f</i> involves mentally working well with novel information and it is dependent on the efficient functioning of the central nervous system.
						In contrast, G<i>c</i> is dependent on education and other forms of acculturation.
						G<i>c</i> consists of the set of skills and information that individuals acquire and retain in memory throughout their lives.
						Cattell (1941) proposed that G<i>f</i> is derived from genetic and biological effects, while G<i>c</i> primarily reflects environmental influences, such as amount of education and socioeconomic status.
