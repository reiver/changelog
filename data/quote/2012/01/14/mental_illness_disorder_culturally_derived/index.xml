						A different group of thinkers — including, most prominently, cultural psychiatrists — sees culture as doing more than just giving different names to universal mental disorders. Culture doesn’t just shape what a mentally ill person calls his or her illness, they argue — it determines what counts as illness in the first place.

						<q>Culture tells us what is normal, what is abnormal, what is deviant, what is not deviant, and where you seek help from,</q> says Bhugra.
					</p>
					<p>
						If this is true — if it’s culture that decides what’s “crazy” and what’s reasonable behavior — then there may be no such thing as an [mental] illness that isn’t culture-bound. It’s not that a handful of disorders no longer belong in a cultural appendix [of the DSM]; it’s that perhaps they all do.
