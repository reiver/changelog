				<blockquote>
					<p>
						A mature organization will have a checklist or framwork for release that facilitates planning.
						Some of the things to be considered are the following.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Which items in the system are (or will be) ready for release?
						</li>
						<li>
							What is required to actually release each item to production?
						</li>
						<li>
							What testing will be required post-release to validate the integrity of production systems?
						</li>
						<li>
							What risks are involved?
						</li>
						<li>
							How are these risks being mitigated?
						</li>
						<li>
							What contingency plans are required?
						</li>
						<li>
							Who needs to be involved in the release and present during the push to production (or other delivery mechanism)?
						</li>
						<li>
							How long will the release take?
						</li>
						<li>
							What other logistics will be involved?
						</li>
					</ul>
