						The Royal Society was not the professional organization it is today;
						[in Thomas Bayes' time] it was a private organization of dues-paying amateurs from the landed gentry.
						But it played a vital role because amateurs would produce some of the era's breakthroughs.

					<p>
						The earl and the Royal's Society's energetic secretary, John Canton, operated an informal network of peer reviewers who critiqued one another's work.
