						My question was simple: Can people make moral judgments just as well when carrying a heavy cognitive load as when carrying a light one?
						The answer turned out to be yes.
						I found no difference between conditions, no effect of cognitive load.
						I tried it again with different stories and got the same outcome.
						I tried another manipulation: I used a computer program to force some people to answer quickly, before they had time to think, and I forced other people to wait ten seconds before offering their judgment.
						Surely that manipulation would weaken or strengthen moral reasoning and shift the balance of power, I though.
						But it didn't.<sup>26</sup>

						I conducted these studies with Stephen Stose and Fredrik Bjorklund.
						I never turned these data into a manuscript because at the time I thought these null findings would be unpublishable.
