						[B]onobos hunt and kill monkeys just like their more vicious chimpanzees cousins, according to new research.
					</p>
					<p>
						[...]
						[<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.eva.mpg.de/primat/files/overview.htm">Gottfried Hohmann</a>] witnessed several monkey hunts among bonobos living in the Democratic Republic of Congo, "they catch it and start eating it. They don't even bother to kill it".
					</p>
					<p>
						[...]
					</p>
					<p>
						Fruit makes up much of their diet, but the primates aren't herbivores.
						Small ungulates called forest antelopes, or duikers, often fall prey to the apes.
					</p>
					<p>
						These hunts tend to be fairly simple, with a single bonobo cornering a duiker then quickly feasting on the still-living animal as more apes hurried to the scene.
						Hohmann says he has witnessed a duiker "still vocally blurting as the bonobos opened the stomach and intestines."
					</p>
					<p>
						[...]
					</p>
					<p>
						Males and females hunt together, and females tended to share their spoils [...].
					</p>
					<p>
						[...]
					</p>
					<p>
						[Frans] de Waal notes that predation and aggression are distinct behaviours [...]
