						An account [by a group of primatologists led by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.eva.mpg.de/primat/files/bonobo.htm">Gottfried Hohmann</a>] of a group of wild bonobos consuming a dead infant [...] is the first report of cannibalism in these animals -- making the species the last of the great apes to reveal a taste for the flesh of their own kind.

						[Eight bonobos] spent the rest of the day devouring the corpse.

						But [Andrew] Fowler noted signs that this meal was somehow different.
						More individuals got a taste of the infant than is typical when the apes share meat.
						They also spent 7Â½ hours eating the body -- longer than they take over a similar-sized monkey.
						Some even played with it.
						"If they just think of it as another piece of meat, why do they behave differently with it?" he asks.
