						T[almer ]S[ommers]:
						Much of your work recently has been aimed at correcting another misconception -- that morality is exclusively a human invention, something that evolved long after we split from other apes.
						Do you think apes and bonobos are moral species?
						Do they exhibit moral behavior?
					</p>
					<p>
						F[rans ]D[e ]W[aal]:
						Well, I usually don't call it moral behavior.
						I tend to call it building blocks or <i>prerequisites</i> for morality.
						[...]
						[T]hey do have empathy, sympathy, reciprocity.
						They share food, resolve conflicts.
						All the elements are present in human morality.
						So what I argue is that the basic psychology of the great apes is an essential <i>element</i> of human morality.
