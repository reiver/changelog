					<p>
						[P]eople always assume women are more peaceful than men.
						Which in many senses is true.
						Look at the murder rate.
						But I do believe that women are not nearly as good at conflict resolution, and that's why they try much harder to avoid conflict.
						And they're often successful.
						But when the conflict surfaces [...] [women hold grudges and] often there is no resolution.
						A lot of women, especially intellectual women, can't stand that idea.
						They're grown up on the the view that women are good and men are bad.
						What men do is compete and fight -- and that's all they can do.
						But it's actually, who was it, Golda Meir, I don't know, a female politician said something to the effect that "It's good that men wage war, because it's only men who can make peace."
