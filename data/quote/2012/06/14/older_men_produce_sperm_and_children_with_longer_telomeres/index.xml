						[S]cientists have discovered that in sperm, telomeres lengthen with age.
					</p>
					<p>
						[...]
					</p>
					<p>
						Dr Dan Eisenberg and colleagues from the Department of Anthropology at Northwestern University studied telomere inheritance in a group of young people living in the Philippines.
					</p>
					<p>
						Telomeres, measured in blood samples, were longer in individuals whose fathers were older when they were born.
					</p>
					<p>
						The telomere lengthening seen with each year that the men delayed fatherhood was equal to the yearly shortening of telomere length that occurs in middle-aged adults.
					</p>
					<p>
						Telomere lengthening was even greater if the child's paternal grandfather had also been older when he became a father.
					</p>
					<p>
						[...]

					<p>
						"The authors did not examine health status in the first generation offspring."
