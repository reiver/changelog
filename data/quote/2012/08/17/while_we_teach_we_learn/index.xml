						“While we teach, we learn,” said the Roman philosopher Seneca.

						[S]cientists are bringing this ancient wisdom up to date, documenting exactly why teaching is such a fruitful way to learn — and designing innovative ways for young people to engage in instruction.

						Students enlisted to tutor others, these researchers have found, work harder to understand the material, recall it more accurately and apply it more effectively.
						In what scientists have dubbed “the protégé effect,” student teachers score higher on tests than pupils who are learning only for their own sake.
						But how can children, still learning themselves, teach others? One answer: They can tutor younger kids.
						The benefits of this practice were indicated by a pair of articles published in 2007 in the journals Science and Intelligence.
						The studies concluded that first-born children are more intelligent than their later-born brothers and sisters and suggested that their higher IQs result from the time they spend showing their younger siblings the ropes.
