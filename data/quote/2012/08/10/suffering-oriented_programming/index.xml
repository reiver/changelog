					<p>
						Suffering-oriented programming can be summarized like so: don't build technology unless you feel the pain of not having it.
						It applies to the big, architectural decisions as well as the smaller everyday programming decisions.
						Suffering-oriented programming greatly reduces risk by ensuring that you're always working on something important, and it ensures that you are well-versed in a problem space before attempting a large investment.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have a mantra for suffering-oriented programming:
						"First make it possible.
						Then make it beautiful.
						Then make it fast."
