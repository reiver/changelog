						As the biochemist Leslie Orgel famously remarked, "Evolution is cleverer than you are", meaning that when an evolutionary process is let loose upon a problem, it will often find solutions that no human designer would have dreamed of.
					</p>
					<p>
						But there is an unhelpful corollary to Orgel's maxim: if the problem is misstated [such as in a virtual environment in a computer, or with a state central planner] then evolution is likely to find loopholes few of us could have imagined.
