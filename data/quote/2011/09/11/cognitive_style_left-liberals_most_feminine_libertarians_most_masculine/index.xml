						The Empathizer-Systemizer scale (adapted from Baron-Cohen, 2004) measures the
						tendency to empathize, defined as "the drive to identify another person's emotions and
						thoughts, and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion." and to systemize, or "the
						drive to analyze the variables in a system, and to derive the underlying rules that govern the
						behavior of the system." In short, empathizing is about understanding the social world
						whereas systemizing is about understanding the world of inanimate objects and nature. We
						selected 20 items from the full 40-item empathizer scale, and 20 items from the full 75-item
						systemizer scale to create a single survey that could be completed in less than 10 minutes.
						The measure was completed by 9,634 participants (5,067 men, 7,854 liberals, 1,010
						conservatives, and 770 libertarians).
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>Results.</i> Figure 10 shows that libertarians score the lowest of any group on
						empathizing, and the highest on systemizing. In fact, libertarians are the only group that
						scored higher on systemizing than on empathizing. Given that these traits are known to differ
						between men and women, it is important to examine these effects in each sex separately.
						Table 2 shows that the same effects hold when looking only at men, or when looking only at
						women.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>Interpretation.</i> Research by Baron-Cohen (2004) has shown that relatively high
						systemizing and low empathizing scores are characteristic of the male brain, with very
						extreme scores indicating autism. We might say that liberals have the most “feminine”
						cognitive style, and libertarians have the most “masculine.” These effects hold even when
						men and women are examined separately, as can be seen in Table 2. These differences have
						many obvious connections to gendered political issues, such as women’s rights, animal rights,
						and social welfare policies. Indeed, the “feminizing” of the Democratic party in the 1970s
						(Winter, in press) may help explain why libertarians moved increasingly into the Republican
						party in the 1980s.

						<i>Compared to liberals and conservatives, libertarians score higher on systemizing and lower
						on empathizing. This is consistent among both men and women sub-samples.
