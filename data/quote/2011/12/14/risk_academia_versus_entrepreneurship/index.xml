					<p>
						[T]he world of science is less accepting of risk than the world of business.
						In technology businesses, a person who pursues a new idea with a reasoned approach can enhance his or her career regardless of whether the particular idea turns out to be successful.
						Many successful entrepreneurs achieved success only after earlier failures.
						But in academia, a couple of years spent pursuing a new idea that does not work out can permanently ruin a young career.
