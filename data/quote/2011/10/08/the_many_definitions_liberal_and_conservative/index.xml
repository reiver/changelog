					<p>
						Marxists in the Soviet Union and its aftermath were called conservatives;
						Reagan and Thatcher were called revolutionaries.
						Liberals [in the U.S.] are liberal about sexual behavior but not about business practices;
						conservatives [in the U.S.] want to conserve communities and traditions, but they also favor the free market economy that subverts them.
						People who call themselves "classical liberals" are likely to be called "conservatives" by adherents of the version of leftism known as political correctness.
