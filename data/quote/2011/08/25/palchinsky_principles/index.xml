					<p>
						[Peter] Palchinsky realised [...] most real-world problems are more complex than we think. They have a human dimension, a local dimension and are likely to change as circumstances change. His method for dealing with this could be summarized as three 'Palchinsky principles': first seek out new ideas and try new things: second, when trying something new, do it on a scale where failure is survivable; third, seek out feedback and learn from your mistakes as you go along.
						The first principle could simply be expressed as [the evolutionary concept of] 'variation'; the third as [the evolutionary concept of] 'selection'.
