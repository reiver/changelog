						in 1995 <a href="http://www.wennergren.org/about/leslie-c-aiello">Leslie Aiello</a>, then of â€¨University College London, and <a href="http://www.ljmu.ac.uk/RCEAP/85796.htm">Peter Wheeler</a> of Liverpool John Moores University offered the first possible reason for the rarity of big brains. Neurons, they pointed out, have a voracious appetite. They require lots of energy to produce their voltage spikes and to release neurotransmitters. They get that energy from oxygen and food, mostly glucose. A three-pound human brain burns up to 20 times as many calories as three pounds of muscle.

						[...] The brain also requires a constant supply of food. Twenty-five percent of all the calories you eat each day end up fueling the brain. For a newborn infant, with its little body and relatively large and fast-growing brain, that figure leaps to 87 percent.
