					<p>
						In acoustics some of the inborn categories of perception are well documented in their relation to physiological facts. To most of us a melody played in different keys remains practically identical to itself. This very astonishing fact is well explained by the finding that in the cortex of the brain, as on a piano keyboard, frequencies are represented on a logarithmic scale [...] (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://ajplegacy.physiology.org/content/203/1/185.short">55</a>). The resulting translational symmetry for tone patterns characterized by constant frequency ratios is one of the basic facts of music.
