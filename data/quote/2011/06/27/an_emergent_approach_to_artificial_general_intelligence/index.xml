						Instead of trying to emulate the mind directly with a computer program, perhaps we can emulate the structure of the brain instead, and let the mind emerge all by itself. Rather than use the digital computer as a logical processing device to run some hypothetical 'algorithm of thought', we can use it as a substitute <em>material</em>, from which we can construct virtual neurons and maybe even virtual chemicals and other biological building blocks inside cyberspace.
