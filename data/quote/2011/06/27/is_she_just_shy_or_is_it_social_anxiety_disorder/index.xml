						A Beautiful woman lowers her eyes demurely beneath a hat. In an earlier era, her gaze might have signaled a mysterious allure. [...] "Is she just shy? Or is it Social Anxiety Disorder?" [...]  [S]hyness and introversion -- or more precisely, the careful, sensitive temperament from which both often spring -- are not just normal. They are valuable. And they may be essential to the survival of our species.
					</p>
					<p>
						Theoretically, shyness and social anxiety disorder are easily distinguishable. But a blurry line divides the two. Imagine that the woman [...] enjoys a steady paycheck, a strong marriage and a small circle of close friends -- a good life by most measures -- except that she avoids a needed promotion because she's nervous about leading meetings. She often criticizes herself for feeling too shy to speak up.

					<p>
						What do you think now? Is she ill, or does she simply need public-speaking training?
