						We are so convinced that the tongue is the source of culinary joy -- we eat too much ice cream because we want to make our mouth happy -- but it's not. Instead, we eat calorically dense foods because we are also trying to pleasure this secondary pathway, which responds not to the nuances of flavor but to the brute intake of energy.
