						Most human beings think almost entirely conceptually. The vast majority of human beings rarely if ever use abstract mathematical symbols to think, and then only in specialized contexts. A "cat" is a concept: a special kind of "animal," another concept, distinguishable from, for example, a "dog," yet another concept. Many things that scientists and engineers deal with are concepts: particle accelerators, rockets, airplanes, electrons, cancer, and so forth. In only a few special cases, such as simple geometrical forms like the perfect sphere, can we express the concept in purely symbolic mathematical terms that can be programmed on a computer.
